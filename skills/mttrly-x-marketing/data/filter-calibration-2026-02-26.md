## Analyst Notes & Refined Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. **Most queries work GREAT.** 18 out of 23 queries have 30%+ signal. The original concern about "too generic queries returning garbage" is largely solved by using exact-phrase matching (`"..."`) with domain-specific terms.

2. **The biggest junk source is `@bankrbot`** — a crypto token deployment bot that uses "deploy failed" language. Add `-bankrbot -"deploy the token" -"on Base" -"fee beneficiary" -web3 -"on-chain"` to pain_points queries.

3. **Three queries should be REMOVED or reworked:**
   - `B1: "vibe coding" ship OR deploy OR launch OR built` — 87% junk. "vibe coding" is now mainstream discussion, not a deploy-focused term. The unqualified OR terms match everything.
   - `B3: "just shipped" side project OR indie OR solo` — 87% junk. "just shipped" matches product launches, app store submissions, etc., not deploy pain.
   - `D2: "just want to ship" -hiring -job` — 83% junk. Too vague, captures general product aspirations.

4. **A7: "prod is down" / "production incident" / "deployment failed"** — 33% signal, 20/30 junk. The problem is `"deployment failed"` matching crypto bots. Replace with `"deployment failed" -token -"on Base" -bankrbot -web3`.

5. **Freshness is the main bottleneck.** Many high-signal queries have few fresh tweets:
   - A4 (hours debugging): 0 tweets < 48h — this is a long-tail query, run weekly not daily
   - A5 (hate devops): 1 tweet < 48h — same, weekly cadence
   - A6 (deployment hell): 5 tweets < 48h — can do every-other-day
   - C4 (leaving heroku): 0 tweets < 48h — weekly

6. **Replies are GOLD:** 83% of replies (197/238) are relevant. This is because reply threads around deploy topics stay on-topic. **Always include replies.**

7. **Like threshold: likes >= 0 for daily scan, likes >= 3 for digest.** At likes >= 1, you keep 186 relevant tweets out of 246 total. At likes >= 3, you get 81 quality tweets. For a digest of 5-15 best tweets, likes >= 3 is optimal.

### Revised Query List for bird-digest.sh

**KEEP (daily, high priority):**
- `"server went down" OR "my server crashed" OR "server is down"` — 100% signal, 22 fresh/24h
- `"why is my app so slow" OR "app keeps crashing" OR "my app crashed"` — 100% signal, 19 fresh/24h
- `"first deploy" OR "deployed my first" OR "first time deploying"` — 80% signal, 15 fresh/24h
- `"vercel bill" OR "vercel cost" OR "vercel expensive" OR "vercel pricing"` — 100% signal, 5 fresh/24h
- `"vibe coder" OR "#vibecoding" deploy OR server OR hosting` — 97% signal, 3 fresh/24h

**KEEP (every-other-day):**
- `"my deploy failed" OR "deployment broke" OR "deploy broke" -bankrbot -token -"on Base"` — 90%+ after crypto filter
- `"too complex to deploy" OR "deployment hell" OR "deploy is broken"` — 100% signal
- `"built with cursor" OR "built with bolt" OR "built with lovable" deploy OR hosting` — 84% signal
- `"I don't know devops" OR "learning to deploy" OR "no devops experience"` — 90% signal
- `"solo developer" server OR infrastructure OR hosting OR deploy` — 93% signal

**KEEP (weekly, long-tail):**
- `"spent hours debugging" deploy OR server OR hosting` — 93% signal but not time-sensitive
- `"hate devops" OR "devops is hard" OR "devops sucks"` — 97% signal, evergreen pain
- `"moved from heroku" OR "leaving heroku" OR "heroku alternative"` — 93% signal
- `"railway app" slow OR down OR expensive OR broken -Indian -train -IRCTC` — 67% signal, needs more exclusions

**REMOVE:**
- `"vibe coding" ship OR deploy OR launch OR built` — 13% signal, too generic
- `"just shipped" side project OR indie OR solo` — 13% signal, off-topic results
- `"just want to ship" -hiring -job` — 17% signal, too vague
- `"prod is down" OR "production incident" OR "deployment failed"` — 33% signal, crypto bot noise

**ADD (new queries to test next time):**
- `"fly.io" OR "flyio" expensive OR slow OR down OR migrating` — Fly.io competitor signal
- `"need to learn devops" OR "should I learn devops"` — audience signal
- `"self-hosted" tired OR frustrated OR expensive OR hard` — self-hosting pain
- `"deploy my side project" OR "host my side project"` — direct intent
- `"aws bill" OR "cloud bill" shocked OR surprised OR expensive` — cloud cost pain

### Exclusion Patterns to Add

Add these to ALL queries to reduce crypto/bot noise:
```
-bankrbot -"deploy the token" -"on Base" -"fee beneficiary" -web3 -"on-chain" -airdrop -$SOL -$ETH
```

### Recommended Scan Schedule

| Cadence | Queries | Like threshold | Freshness | Expected yield |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Morning (6am) | 5 high-priority | >= 0 | < 24h | 10-20 relevant |
| Evening (4pm) | 5 high-priority | >= 0 | < 8h | 3-8 relevant |
| Every-other-day | 5 medium-priority | >= 1 | < 48h | 8-15 relevant |
| Weekly (Monday) | 4 long-tail | >= 3 | < 7d | 10-20 relevant |
