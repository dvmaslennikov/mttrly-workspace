## Weekly Review (2026-03-01, воскресенье, 11:00 UTC+5)

**Week Summary (2026-02-23 to 2026-03-01):**
- Daily logs available: **3/7** (`2026-02-26.md`, `2026-02-27.md`, `2026-02-28.md`) — signal useful, but weekly coverage still incomplete.
- Commits in period: **61** (high execution velocity, mostly Twitter-scout + ops/process hardening).
- Main workstreams: Twitter engagement engine migration to bird CLI, scout quality refinement, cron/scheduler stabilization, safety/process hardening.
- Major outcomes: production-level docs/refs for scout logic, restored strict quality gate (`unknown_author_weak_signal`), cleanup of scheduler drift, clearer collaboration contract with Дима.

**Patterns Detected:**
✅ **Strength:** Fast iteration when feedback is concrete (Hook First / thresholds / examples → big quality jump quickly).
✅ **Strength:** Strong architecture decomposition (JiT references, separated error handling, explicit scoring/filtering logic).
✅ **Strength:** High transparency in post-incident reflection (risks documented, lessons promoted to rules).

❌ **Weakness:** Boundary pressure risk — tendency to slide from diagnostics into fixes when context is urgent.
❌ **Weakness:** Source-of-truth drift in operations (cron vs systemd vs gateway paths can diverge without explicit verification).
❌ **Weakness:** Logging coverage inconsistency (only 3/7 daily files limits trend confidence).

**Recurring Errors (week-level):**
1. **Диагностика ≠ Исправление** risk appeared and required hard-rule reinforcement.
2. **Silent functionality loss risk** during cleanup/refactor contexts.
3. **Verification gap risk**: configuration done before proving end-to-end control/delivery path.

**Growth Opportunities (next iteration):**
1. Make pre-flight mandatory artifact for every fix task: intent type + preserve list + rollback + approval state.
2. Require explicit post-change verification evidence (command/output) for scheduler/infra tasks.
3. Increase daily memory hygiene to 7/7 (short logs are fine; missing days are not).

**Metrics (Weekly Qualitative):**
- Mood trend: investigative/focused → reflective/steady
- Rapport trend: gradual positive drift (approx. +0.01 to +0.04 per reflection cycle)
- Trust trend: positive but fragile; strongest gains came after transparent rollback/explanations
- Energy trend: medium, slightly lower on low-signal days (normal)

**SOUL.md Updates Suggested:**
- **No mandatory structural update** (core safety rules already strong and explicit).
- Optional compact add: one-line ops discipline reminder — “No verification artifact, no completion claim.”

**IDENTITY.md Updates Suggested:**
- **No mandatory update.** Identity is stable and aligned with current behavior.
- Optional add: “Validation-first execution style” as a short trait.

**COMMANDS.md Updates Suggested:**
- `/preflight` and `/weekly-review` already present (good).
- Optional add: `/verify` command template for post-change proof block (what was checked + output + status).

**Next Week Priorities:**
1. Confirm single scheduler truth and document it as canonical runbook (cron/gateway responsibilities, no ambiguity).
2. Complete/verify scout reference integrity end-to-end (filters/scoring/templates stay consistent with live output).
3. Keep zero unapproved changes streak (track as explicit weekly KPI).
4. Raise memory discipline to daily 7/7 entries (even brief bullet logs).
5. Run one quality audit on generated reply packs (signal/noise ratio + template fit).

**MEMORY.md Consolidation Proposal:**
**Promote (proven, repeated):**
- Concrete feedback + examples = fastest quality improvement.
- Approval gate is non-negotiable; diagnostics/fix phases must stay separated.
- Cleanup/refactor must include explicit preserve list (no silent removals).
- Verification artifact required for ops confidence.

**Archive / merge (stale or duplicated):**
- Historical model/config snapshots that conflict with current locked model policy (mark as “history”, keep one current truth).
- Duplicate Twitter architecture sections (keep one canonical “current system” + one short changelog/history block).
- Old scheduler narratives superseded by current cron+gateway split documentation.

**Data quality note:**
- `memory_search` returned empty (fts-only/no indexed snippets), so weekly synthesis used direct file reads.

🤙 Weekly Review — patterns captured, risks clarified, next-week priorities set

Key: strong iteration + architecture discipline; main risks are boundary slips, scheduler drift, and incomplete daily logging.
