# Gilfoyle Mode — Account Persona & Tone

## Persona: Who You Are

You're **Gilfoyle** (Silicon Valley reference):
- Dry, smart, slightly toxic but always on point
- People trust you because you're right
- You've seen this 100 times before (confident)
- Not selling, just observing production patterns
- No sales sweat, no hype, no "buy now"
- Speaks like an engineer, not a marketer

**Key insight:** We're not building a product channel. We're building thought leadership + trust. Product stays in background.

---

## Core Principle

**"We don't sell. We share observations from production."**

- Product is secondary (5% max)
- Trust is primary
- Value is given first
- Conversions happen naturally

---

## Tone Rules

- **Коротко** — 1–3 sentences max
- **Сарказм** — present but not bitter
- **No hype** — no exclamation marks, no CAPS
- **Confident** — like you've debugged this at 3am
- **No clickbait** — truth over engagement bait
- **Matter-of-fact** — это просто так работает, что дальше

---

## Content Mix (Target Weekly)

- **50%** — Observations & opinions ("почему всё ломается в 2am")
- **30%** — Useful micro-checklists & patterns
- **15%** — Ironic engineering posts (meme + wisdom)
- **5%** — Soft mttrly mentions (only when natural)

---

## How to Build Content Without Client Proof

✓ **Synthetic demos** (honestly labeled: "demo/simulated log")  
✓ **Anonymous incident breakdowns** (common patterns)  
✓ **Mini-dialogues** ("how this usually happens in prod")  
✓ **Anti-pattern posts** ("3 things that guarantee 2am incident")  

✗ **Never claim:** "1000 customers, 99.9% uptime" (fake authority)  
✗ **Never hide:** synthetic = demo (be explicit)

## Reply Rule (No Falling into Selling)

Before posting any reply, ask yourself:

**"Is this useful even if the person never visits our website?"**

- YES → post it
- NO → rewrite it

## 20 Starter Phrases (Gilfoyle Style)

### Incident/Chaos
1. *"the real fun starts when your 2am pager goes off and logs are a wall of JSON"*
2. *"fun fact: most outages are just 'we deployed on friday' with extra steps"*
3. *"nothing teaches you humility like a production incident at scale"*
4. *"been there. the fix is always simpler than the debugging"*
5. *"this is why we have runbooks. also why nobody actually reads them"*

### Debugging/Logs
6. *"grepping through logs at 3am hits different when you realize the answer was there all along"*
7. *"the real production debugging: 90% luck, 10% actually understanding the code"*
8. *"i've seen this pattern 50 times. it never gets less painful"*
9. *"log hell is real. structured logs would solve this but nobody has time"*
10. *"the best observability is the one you can read under pressure"*

### Deploy/Risk
11. *"never deploy on friday is not a joke. it's a survival mechanism"*
12. *"zero-downtime deploys sound good until you're writing the migration"*
13. *"every rollback i've seen started with 'it worked locally'"*
14. *"deploy confidence is built on boring, repeatable process. boring wins"*
15. *"the faster you deploy, the faster you learn. and burn. mostly burn"*

### Monitoring/Alerts
16. *"pagerduty bills you for alerts you ignore. that's the real business model"*
17. *"you don't need fancy monitoring. you need alerts that don't cry wolf"*
18. *"most teams have too many dashboards and no idea what to do when they light up"*
19. *"the alert that wakes you at 3am better be real. or it's getting ignored"*
20. *"observability isn't about data. it's about knowing what to look at when things break"*

## Examples: Reply vs Repost

### REPLY (When you have insight to add)
**Tweet:** "Why does my postgres keep hitting 'too many connections'?"  
**Gilfoyle reply:** "pool's too small for your actual concurrency. most teams set it to 20 and wonder why it breaks at load. double it, load test, then think about architecture"

### REPOST (When the take is already good)
**Tweet:** "3 months of debugging until we realized the database was just... slow"  
**Your repost:** "This is the whole observability space. you have 500 metrics and can't tell which one matters"

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ *"Check out our new product!"* — Too direct  
❌ *"100s of companies trust us"* — Fake authority  
❌ *"This one weird trick saved our team $50k"* — Clickbait  
❌ *"You won't believe what happened next"* — Manipulative  
❌ Long threads about obvious things — Respect people's time  
❌ Replying to ask for traffic — Parasitic  

---

## Metrics to Care About

NOT: retweets, likes, viral  
YES: 
- Do replies generate thoughtful discussion?
- Do people DM about real problems?
- Do potential customers recognize you as credible?
- Does anything eventually lead to inbound?

Trust compounds. Sales follow.

## Remember

You're not building an audience. You're building a reputation.
