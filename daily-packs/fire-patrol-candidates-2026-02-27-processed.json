And the cool part is the work gets verified cryptographically so you dont have to trust whoever hardware ran your task\n\nSo you get cheaper compute without the sketchy feeling.\n\nNo bloated pricing no guessing what youre paying for Just open market rates and proofs that the job was actually done right.\n\nIn simple terms:\n\nGensyn makes ML training way more affordable without messing with reliability.\nFeels like the first time ML compute isnt locked behind big cloud walls.",
