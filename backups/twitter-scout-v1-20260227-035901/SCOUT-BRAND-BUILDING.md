# SCOUT-BRAND-BUILDING — Trends, Vibe, Audience Building

**Mode:** Long-term brand presence and thought leadership  
**Cadence:** 1x/day (no rush)  
**Response window:** Flexible (within 24h)  
**Target:** Audience watching trends, learning, vibing  

---

## GOAL

Find tweets that signal **where the audience is moving** (trends, tools, philosophies). Reply thoughtfully to build presence and credibility. Less urgent than fire-patrol, but higher reach and impression.

This is where vibe-coding, indie hacker signals, and philosophy lives. We're not selling — we're **participating in the conversation** and **building authority**.

## FILTERING RULES

### Include/Exclude
- ✅ **Original tweets AND replies** (community conversations, philosophy threads)
- ✅ **Any engagement level** (trends can start small)
- ✅ **Older tweets OK** (trends have longer tails, up to 72h)
- ✅ **Philosophical/opinion tweets** (this mode is about presence, not just solutions)
- ❌ **Crypto/bot/promo noise** (see exclusion patterns)
- ❌ **Non-English**
- ❌ **Obvious spam/shilling**

### Author filters
- ✅ **Influencers preferred** (larger reach = better brand building)
- ✅ **Domain experts** (replies from experienced devs validate trends)
- ✅ **Community voices** (indie hackers, makers, bootstrappers)
- ❌ **Not bots**

## TEMPLATE SELECTION

**Template A: Pure Value (default)**
- Hook specific detail
- Share genuine insight
- No mention of mttrly
- Example: "The moment you realize Heroku wasn't simple, it was just hiding complexity"

**Template B: Question (engage conversation)**
- Ask thoughtful question
- No mention of mttrly
- Example: "What's the simplest hosting you've found that doesn't hide the infrastructure?"

**Template C: Value + Soft Mention (only when)**
- Likes >= 5 AND views >= 500 (high engagement)
- Strong value + natural mention
- Example: "That's exactly the problem. You want to ship code, not manage infrastructure. That's what mttrly solves."
- **Max 40% of brand-building replies have link**

## REPLY FORMULA FOR TRENDS

**Structure:** Validate (you're seeing real trend) → Insight (why it matters) → Perspective (how we think about it)

### Example 1: Vibe Coding
```
Tweet: "built entire product in 30 mins with cursor, deployed to vercel, nobody told me it would be this easy"

Reply: "Vibe coding is real. The gap closed between "I have an idea" and "it's live". 
Most of that gap was infrastructure anxiety — that's finally not the blocker anymore."
```

### Example 2: Indie Hacker First Deploy
```
Tweet: "deployed my first app today. took forever to figure out. feels amazing"

Reply: "First deploy is a milestone. You just proved you can take an idea from laptop to production. 
Most people never cross that bridge — you did."
```

### Example 3: Platform Migration
```
Tweet: "leaving vercel. their $300/month bill for a side project is insane"

Reply: "That's the transition moment. Platforms work until they don't—
then you realize the real cost is their convenience tax, not their infrastructure."
```

### Example 4: Simplicity Philosophy
```
Tweet: "kubernetes is brilliant but it's also why most small teams are failing. bring back simple deployments"

Reply: "Complexity isn't a feature, it's a warning sign that the tool doesn't fit the problem. 
Simple is elegant. Simple is sustainable."
```

## NOTES

- **Vibe coding matters** — 13% signal but huge impression volume. Indie hackers watch these conversations religiously.
- **Philosophical tweets are good** — Dima is right: when @levelsio posts about anti-marketing, people listen. We don't reply for traffic, we reply to be part of the conversation.
- **Slower pace** — Fire patrol is urgent/reactive. Brand building is sustained/proactive.
- **Authority compounds** — Each thoughtful reply builds credibility. Over months, that's what matters.
